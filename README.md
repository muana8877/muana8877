I build apps and digital products on the web.

i like turning ideas into real, usable things, sometimes client work, sometimes just experimenting.

Right now, I work mostly with React, Tailwind, Firebase, and Laravel when the product needs a real backend.

I enjoy building full products, not just screens, but logic, flows, edge cases… and even delivering SEO-friendly CMS sites to clients.

fun facts:  
- I learned design basics for the frontend, but fell in love with it
- ran a YouTube channel that crossed 2M+ views at 15  
- anime & pixel vibes have my heart 👾
